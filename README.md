## Build Artefacts
Each build process produces a single PDF. This is either a release version for public distribution, or a continuous integration (CI) build for use

## Build Process

CI builds are triggered by any 'push' or 'pull-request'.
Release builds are triggered by adding a git tag to a commit of the form 'Release-foobar. In this case the value of foobar will be used as the document identifier on both the cover and in the resulting artefact file name.
